# Working Link to App Here: [Expensify App](https://react-practice-app.herokuapp.com/) 

## From Andrew Mead's Udemy Course: [The Complete React Web Developer Course (with Redux)](https://www.udemy.com/react-2nd-edition/)


NOTE: This project is a practice app which I built following the udemy course above.  It was meant to help me learn React and the code is very messy with comments, etc. which are notes I added during the course and which I can use as a reference in the future.  

If you're learning React, you may find the comments helpful.
